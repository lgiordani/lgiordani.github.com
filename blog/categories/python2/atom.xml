<p>Welcome to the third installment of this little series of posts about Python 2.x OOP implementation. The <a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1">first</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/03/10/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-2">second</a> issues introduced the most important concepts at the basis of Python as an object-oriented language.</p>

<p>This post will continue the discussion about metaclasses, introducing Abstract Base Classes, and give some insights on callable objects.</p>

<p>This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the <strong>updated version</strong> <a href="/blog/categories/python3/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The Inspection Club</h2>

<p>As you know, Python leverages polymorphism at its maximum by dealing only with generic references to objects. This makes OOP not an addition to the language but part of its structure from the ground up. Moreover, Python pushes the EAFP appoach, which tries to avoid direct inspection of objects as much as possible.</p>

<p>It is however very interesting to read what Guido van Rossum says in <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/">PEP 3119</a>: <em>Invocation means interacting with an object by invoking its methods. Usually this is combined with polymorphism, so that invoking a given method may run different code depending on the type of an object. Inspection means the ability for external code (outside of the object's methods) to examine the type or properties of that object, and make decisions on how to treat that object based on that information. [...] In classical OOP theory, invocation is the preferred usage pattern, and inspection is actively discouraged, being considered a relic of an earlier, procedural programming style. However, in practice this view is simply too dogmatic and inflexible, and leads to a kind of design rigidity that is very much at odds with the dynamic nature of a language like Python.</em></p>

<p>The author of Python recognizes that forcing the use of a pure polymorphic approach leads sometimes to solutions that are too complex or even incorrect. In this section I want to show some of the problems that can arise from a pure polymorphic approach and introduce Abstract Base Classes, which aim to solve them. I strongly suggest to read <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/">PEP 3119</a> (as for any other PEP) since it contains a deeper and better explanation of the whole matter. Indeed I think that this PEP is so well written that any further explanation is hardly needed. I am however used to write explanations to check how much I understood about the topic, so I am going to try it this time too.</p>

<h4>E.A.F.P the Extra Test Trial</h4>

<p>The EAFP coding style requires you to trust the incoming objects to provide the attributes and methods you need, and to manage the possible exceptions, if you know how to do it. Sometimes, however, you need to test if the incoming object matches a complex behaviour. For example, you could be interested in testing if the object <em>acts</em> like a list, but you quickly realize that the amount of methods a <code>list</code> provides is very big and this could lead to odd EAFP code like</p>

<p>``` python
try:</p>

<pre><code>obj.append
obj.count
obj.extend
obj.index
obj.insert
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>except AttributeError:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>where the methods of the <code>list</code> type are accessed (not called) just to force the object to raise the <code>AttributeError</code> exception if they are not present. This code, however, is not only ugly but also wrong. If you recall the "Enter the Composition" section of the <a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1">first post</a>, you know that in Python you can always customize the <code>__getattr__()</code> method, which is called whenever the requested attribute is not found in the object. So I could write a class that passes the test but actually does not act like a list</p>

<p>``` python
class FakeList(object):</p>

<pre><code>def fakemethod(self):
    pass

def __getattr__(self, name):
    if name in ['append', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', ...]:
        return self.fakemethod
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is obviously just an example, and no one will ever write such a class, but this demonstrates that just accessing methods does not guarantee that a class <em>acts</em> like the one we are expecting.</p>

<p>There are many examples that could be done leveraging the highly dynamic nature of Python and its rich object model. I would summarize them by saying that sometimes you'd better to check the type of the incoming object.</p>

<p>In Python you can obtain the type of an object using the <code>type()</code> built-in function, but to check it you'd better use <code>isinstance()</code>, which returns a boolean value. Let us see an example before moving on</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>isinstance([], list)
True
isinstance(1, int)
True
class Door(object):
...  pass
...
d = Door()
isinstance(d, Door)
True
class EnhancedDoor(Door):
...  pass
...
ed = EnhancedDoor()
isinstance(ed, EnhancedDoor)
True
isinstance(ed, Door)
True
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see the function can also walk the class hierarchy, so the check is not so trivial like the one you would obtain by directly using <code>type()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>isinstance()</code> function, however, does not completely solve the problem. If we write a class that actually <em>acts</em> like a <code>list</code> but does not inherit from it, <code>isinstance()</code> does not recognize the fact that the two may be considered the same thing. The following code returns <code>False</code> regardless the content of the <code>MyList</code> class</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class MyList(object):
...  pass
...
ml = MyList()
isinstance(ml, list)
False
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>since <code>isinstance()</code> does not check the content of the class or its behaviour, it just consider the class and its ancestors.</p>

<p>The problem, thus, may be summed up with the following question: what is the best way to test that an object exposes a given interface? Here, the word <em>interface</em> is used for its natural meaning, without any reference to other programming solutions, which however address the same problem.</p>

<p>A good way to address the problem could be to write inside an attribute of the object the list of interfaces it promises to implement, and to agree that any time we want to test the behaviour of an object we simply have to check the content of this attribute. This is exactly the path followed by Python, and it is very important to understand that the whole system is just about a promised behaviour.</p>

<p>The solution proposed through PEP 3119 is, in my opinion, very simple and elegant, and it perfectly fits the nature of Python, where things are usually agreed rather than being enforced. Not only, the solution follows the spirit of polymorphism, where information is provided by the object itself and not extracted by the calling code.</p>

<p>In the next sections I am going to try and describe this solution in its main building blocks. The matter is complex so my explanation will lack some details: please refer to the forementioned PEP 3119 for a complete description.</p>

<h4>Who Framed the Metaclasses</h4>

<p>As already described, Python provides two built-ins to inspect objects and classes, which are <code>isinstance()</code> and <code>issubclass()</code> and it would be desirable that a solution to the inspection problem allows the programmer to go on with using those two functions.</p>

<p>This means that we need to find a way to inject the "behaviour promise" into both classes and instances. This is the reason why metaclasses come in play. If you recall what we said about them in the second issue of this series, metaclasses are the classes used to build classes, which means that they are the preferred way to change the structure of a class, and, in consequence, of its instances.</p>

<p>Another way to do the same job would be to leverage the inheritance mechanism, injecting the behaviour through a dedicated parent class. This solution has many downsides, which I'm am not going to detail. It is enough to say that affecting the class hierarchy may lead to complex situations or subtle bugs. Metaclasses may provide here a different entry point for the introduction of a "virtual base class" (as PEP 3119 specifies, this is not the same concept as in C++).</p>

<h4>Overriding Places</h4>

<p>As said, <code>isinstance()</code> and <code>issubclass()</code> are built-in functions, not object methods, so we cannot simply override them providing a different implementation in a given class. So the first part of the solution is to change the behaviour of those two functions to first check if the class or the instance contain a special method, which is <code>__instancecheck__()</code> for <code>isinstance()</code> and <code>__subclasscheck__()</code> for <code>issubclass()</code>. So both built-ins try to run the respective special method, reverting to the standard algorithm if it is not present.</p>

<p>A note about naming. Methods must accept the object they belong to as the first argument, so the two special methods shall have the form</p>

<p>``` python
def <strong>instancecheck</strong>(cls, inst):
   [...]</p>

<p>def <strong>subclasscheck</strong>(cls, sub):
   [...]
```</p>

<p>where <code>cls</code> is the class where they are injected, that is the one representing the promised behaviour. The two built-ins, however, have a reversed argument order, where the behaviour comes after the tested object: when you write <code>isinstance([], list)</code> you want to check if the <code>[]</code> instance has the <code>list</code> behaviour. This is the reason behind the name choice: just calling the methods <code>__isinstance__()</code> and <code>__issubclass__()</code> and passing arguments in a reversed order would have been confusing.</p>

<h4>This is ABC</h4>

<p>The proposed solution is thus called Abstract Base Classes, as it provides a way to attach to a concrete class a virtual class with the only purpose of signaling a promised behaviour to anyone inspecting it with <code>isinstance()</code> or <code>issubclass()</code>.</p>

<p>To help programmers implement Abstract Base Classes, the standard library has been given an <code>abc</code> module, thet contains the <code>ABCMeta</code> class (and other facilities). This class is the one that implements <code>__instancecheck__()</code> and <code>__subclasscheck__()</code> and shall be used as a metaclass to augment a standard class. This latter will then be able to register other classes as implementation of its behaviour.</p>

<p>Sounds complex? An example may clarify the whole matter. The one from the official documentation is rather simple:</p>

<p>``` python
from abc import ABCMeta</p>

<p>class MyABC:</p>

<pre><code>__metaclass__ = ABCMeta
</code></pre>

<p>MyABC.register(tuple)</p>

<p>assert issubclass(tuple, MyABC)
assert isinstance((), MyABC)
```</p>

<p>Here, the <code>MyABC</code> class is provided the <code>ABCMeta</code> metaclass. This puts the two <code>__instancecheck__()</code> and <code>__subclasscheck__()</code> behaviours inside <code>MyABC</code>. Please note however that those methods are not actually put into the object so that you can use them like</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>d = {'a': 1}
MyABC.<strong>metaclass</strong>.<strong>instancecheck</strong>(MyABC, d)
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>that returns <code>True</code> if the dictionary <code>d</code> is an instance of the Abstract Base Class <code>MyABC</code>. In other words if the dictionary <code>d</code> implements the behaviour promised by the <code>MyABC</code> class.</p>

<p>After the definition of <code>MyABC</code> we need a way to signal that a given class is an instance of the Abstract Base Class and this happens through the <code>register()</code> method, provided by the <code>ABCMeta</code> metaclass. Calling <code>MyABC.register(tuple)</code> we record inside <code>MyABC</code> the fact that the <code>tuple</code> class shall be identified as a subclass of <code>MyABC</code> itself. This is analogous to saying that <code>tuple</code> inherits from <code>MyABC</code> but not quite the same. As already said registering a class in an Abstract Base Class with <code>register()</code> does not affect the class hierarchy. Indeed, the whole <code>tuple</code> class is unchanged.</p>

<h2>Little Shop of Collections</h2>

<p>In addition to the <code>abc</code> module, the standard library now provides a <code>collections</code> module that, besides some interesting container datatypes like <code>namedtuple</code> and <code>OrderedDict</code>, supplies a remarkable number of ABCs that represent container behaviours. An example is <code>collections.Sized</code> that pledges that the registered class will contain the <code>__len__()</code> method, enabling the code to pass it to the <code>len()</code> builtin. Let us exemplify that:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class Snake(object):
...   def <strong>init</strong>(self, meters):
...     self.len = meters
...   def <strong>len</strong>(self):
...     return self.len
...</p>

<p>s = Snake(5)
len(s)
5</p>

<p>import collections
collections.Sized.register(Snake)</p>

<p>issubclass(Snake, collections.Sized)
True
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>If not stressed enough, ABCs assure that a given behaviour will be implemented but there is no actual check of this. For example:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class FakeSnake(object):
...   def <strong>init</strong>(self, meters):
...     pass
...</p>

<p>collections.Sized.register(FakeSnake)
issubclass(FakeSnake, collections.Sized)
True
f = FakeSnake(6)
len(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: object of type 'FakeSnake' has no len()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Remember that ABCs are classes just like any other standard Python class, which means that they can be inherited to build more specialized ABCs.</p>

<h4>The Naked Class</h4>

<p>The <code>abc</code> module provides two decorators <code>@abstractmethod</code> and <code>@abstractproperty</code> to help the design of Abstract Base Classes. The first decorator, <code>@abstractmethod</code>, may only be used in a class which metaclass is <code>ABCMeta</code> (just like the example <code>MyABC</code> class described above). Decorating a method with it blocks the instantiation of the class itself until that method is overridden. That enables to write classes that may inherited only if the child class provides an implementation of some specific methods. The <code>@abstractproperty</code> decorator provides the same service for properties.</p>

<p>Let us run through a very simple example:</p>

<p>``` python
import abc</p>

<p>class AbstractCalculator(object):</p>

<pre><code>__metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta

@abc.abstractmethod
def sum(a, b):
    pass

@abc.abstractmethod
def mutiply(a, b):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is a class with <code>ABCMeta</code> as its metaclass, which makes <code>AbstractCalculator</code> an Abstract Base Class. The two <code>sum()</code> and <code>multiply()</code> methods are decorated with <code>@abstractmethod</code>, that raises an exception when we try to instance the class:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>ac = AbstractCalculator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class AbstractCalculator with abstract methods mutiply, sum</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, any class that derives from <code>AbstractCalculator</code> and does not override the two methods (implementing them), cannot be instantiated:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class Calculator(AbstractCalculator):
...  pass
...
c = Calculator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Calculator with abstract methods mutiply, sum</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>These two decorators are the standard way to enforce a check about a behaviour or an interface, and are the closest thing to a "strict interface check".</p>

<h2>A Fish Called Object</h2>

<p>In the first post, when I discussed for the first time the concept of instantiation, I stated that an instance of a class may be obtained by calling the class itself just like a function. Let me recall you the example</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>b = int()
type(b)
<type 'int'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Later, speaking about methods and attributes, I defined <em>callable</em> something that can be invoked with that syntax. Thus, we can now say that classes are callables, just like methods. What makes an object callable, anyway? It turns out that, as many other things in Python, the solution is pretty straightforward: an object is callable if it contains the <code>__call__()</code> method. Simple, isn't it?</p>

<p>When we execute a syntax like</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>some_object()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Python executes under the hood the following code</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>some_object.<strong>call</strong>()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>where any parameter passed to the class is obviously passed to <code>__call__()</code>.</p>

<p>For standard classes the <code>__call__()</code> method is provided by <code>type</code>, which is the standard metaclass. So when we write</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>b = int()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>python actually executes this code</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>b = int.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>call</strong>(int)
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This standard implementation of <code>__call__()</code> runs the constructor mechanism as depicted in the second post, executing <code>__new__()</code> and <code>__init__()</code> to get a new instance and initialize it.</p>

<p>The definition of callable object is very powerful, since it allows to flatten the difference between classes and functions. In OOP many times the two are presented as two completely separated concepts, but in Python it is usually more convenient to talk about callables. Here, Python shows its polymorphic nature at its maximum: if I expect a function and what is given to me is something that acts like a function everything is fine. Functions, however, are themselves simple callable objects. Remember: in Python everything is an object.</p>

<p>Since <code>__call__()</code> is a method we can redefine it in any class, let us try and see what happens</p>

<p>``` python
class CallMe(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __call__(self, *args, **kwds):
    return 1
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Class instances usually contain no definition of <code>__call__()</code> and the implementation provided in the class hierarchy prevents them from being called</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>a = int()
a()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Nothing forbids us to define a custom <code>__call__()</code> method inside the instance and make it callable. This allows us to pass the instance where Python expects a function or, better, a callable. A classical example is the <code>sort()</code> method of <code>list</code> objects, which accepts an optional callable <code>f</code> that shall compare objects. Here, a callable instance is accepted just like a plain function.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This post continues the analysis of the Python OOP implementation started with <a href="/blog/2014/03/05/oop-concepts-in-python-2-dot-x-part-1">this post</a>, which I recommend reading before taking on this new one.</p>

<p>This second post discusses the following OOP features in Python:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Classes and instances (again)</li>
<li>Metaclasses</li>
<li>Object creation</li>
</ul>


<p>This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the <strong>updated version</strong> <a href="/blog/categories/python3/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Good Morning, Polymorphism</h2>

<p>The term <em>polymorphism</em>, in the OOP lingo, refers to the ability of an object to adapt the code to the type of the data it is processing.</p>

<p>Polymorphism has two major applications in an OOP language. The first is that an object may provide different implementations of one of its methods depending on the type of the input parameters. The second is that code written for a given type of data may be used on data with a derived type, i.e. methods understand the class hierarchy of a type.</p>

<p>In Python polymorphism is one of the key concepts, and we can say that it is a built-in feature. Let us deal with it step by step.</p>

<p>First of all, you know that in Python the type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Beware that this does not mean that Python variables are <em>untyped</em>. On the contrary, everything in Python has a type, it just happens that the type is implicitly assigned. If you remember the last paragraph of the previous post, I stated that in Python variables are just pointers (using a C-like nomenclature), in other words they just tell the language <em>where</em> in memory a variable has been stored. What is stored at that address is not a business of the variable.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>a = 5
a
5
type(a)
<type 'int'>
hex(id(a))
'0x89812b0'
a = "five"
a
'five'
type(a)
<type 'str'>
hex(id(a))
'0xb74bb280L'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This little example shows a lot about the Python typing system. The variable <code>a</code> is not statically declared, after all it can contain only one type of data: a memory address. When we assign the number 5 to it, Python stores in <code>a</code> the <em>address</em> of the number 5 (<code>0x89812b0</code> in my case, but your result will be different). The <code>type()</code> built-in function is smart enough to understand that we are not asking about the type of <code>a</code> (which is always a reference), but about the type of the content. When you store another value in <code>a</code>, the string <code>"five"</code>, Python shamelessly replaces the previous content of the variable with the new address.</p>

<p>So, thanks to the reference system, Python type system is both <em>strong</em> and <em>dynamic</em>. The exact definition of those two concepts is not universal, so if you are interested be ready to dive into a broad matter. However, in Python, the meaning of those two words is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>type system is <em>strong</em> because everything has a well-defined type, that you can check with the <code>type()</code> built-in</li>
<li>type system is <em>dynamic</em> since the type of a variable is not explicitly declared, but changes with the content</li>
</ul>


<p>Onward! We just scratched the surface of the whole thing.</p>

<p>To explore the subject a little more, try to define the simplest function in Python (apart from an empty function)</p>

<p>``` python
def echo(a):</p>

<pre><code>return a
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Pretty straightforward, isn't it? Well, if you come from a statically compiled language such as C or C++ you should be at least puzzled. What is <code>a</code>? I mean: what type of data does it contain? Moreover, how can Python know what it is returning if there is no type specification?</p>

<p>Again, if you recall the references stuff everything becomes clear: that function accepts a reference and returns a reference. In other words we just defined a sort of universal function, that does the same thing regardless of the input.</p>

<p>This is exactly the problem that polymorphism wants to solve. We want to describe an action regardless of the type of objects, and this is what we do when we talk among humans. When you describe how to move an object by pushing it, you may explain it using a box, but you expect the person you are addressing to be able to repeat the action even if you need to move a pen, or a book, or a bottle.</p>

<p>There are two main strategies you can apply to get code that performs the same operation regardless of the input types.</p>

<p>The first approach is to cover all cases, and this is a typical approach of procedural languages. If you need to sum two numbers that can be integers, float or complex, you just need to write three <code>sum()</code> functions, one bound to the integer type, the second bound to the float type and the third bound to the complex type, and to have some language feature that takes charge of choosing the correct implementation depending on the input type. This logic can be implemented by a compiler (if the language is statically typed) or by a runtime environment (if the language is dynamically typed) and is the approach chosen by C++. The disadvantage of this solution is that it requires the programmer to forecast all the possible situations: what if I need to sum an integer with a float? What if I need to sum two lists? (Please note that C++ is not so poorly designed, and the operator overloading technique allows to manage such cases, but the base polymorphism strategy of that language is the one exposed here).</p>

<p>The second strategy, the one implemented by Python, is simply to require the input objects to solve the problem for you. In other words you <em>ask the data itself to perform the operation</em>, reversing the problem. Instead of writing a bunch on functions that sum all the possible types in every possible combination you just write one function that requires the input data to sum, trusting that they know how to do it. Does it sound complex? It is not.</p>

<p>Let's look at the Python implementation of the <code>+</code> operator. When we write <code>c = a + b</code>, Python actually executes <code>c = a.__add__(b)</code>. As you can see the sum operation is delegated to the first input variable. So if we write</p>

<p>``` python
def sum(a, b):</p>

<pre><code>return a + b
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>there is no need to specify the type of the two input variables. The object <code>a</code> (the object contained in the variable <code>a</code>) shall be able to sum with the object <code>b</code>. This is a very beautiful and simple implementation of the polymorphism concept. Python functions are polymorphic simply because they accept everything and trust the input data to be able to perform some actions.</p>

<p>Let us consider another simple example before moving on. The built-in <code>len()</code> function returns the length of the input object. For example</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>l = [1, 2, 3]
len(l)
3
s = "Just a sentence"
len(s)
15
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see it is perfectly polymorphic: you can feed both a list or a string to it and it just computes its length. Does it work with any type? let's check</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
len(d)
2
i = 5
len(i)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Ouch! Seems that the <code>len()</code> function is smart enough to deal with dictionaries, but not with integers. Well, after all, the length of an integer is not defined.</p>

<p>Indeed this is exactly the point of Python polymorphism: <em>the integer type does not define a length operation</em>. While you blame the <code>len()</code> function, the <code>int</code> type is at fault. The <code>len()</code> function just calls the <code>__len__()</code> method of the input object, as you can see from this code</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>l.<strong>len</strong>()
3
s.<strong>len</strong>()
15
d.<strong>len</strong>()
2
i.<strong>len</strong>()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute '<strong>len</strong>'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>but the <code>'int' object</code> does not define any <code>__len__()</code> method.</p>

<p>So, to sum up what we discovered until here, I would say that <em>Python polymorphism is based on delegation</em>. In the following sections we will talk about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-eafp">EAFP</a> Python principle, and you will see that the delegation principle is somehow ubiquitous in this language.</p>

<h2>Type Hard</h2>

<p>Another real-life concept that polymorphism wants to bring into a programming language is the ability to walk the class hierarchy, that is <em>to run code on specialized types</em>. This is a complex sentence to say something we are used to do every day, and an example will clarify the matter.</p>

<p>You know how to open a door, it is something you learned in your early years. Under an OOP point of view you are an object (sorry, no humiliation intended) which is capable of interacting with a wood rectangle rotating on hinges. When you can open a door, however, you can also open a window, which, after all, is a specialized type of wood-rectangle-with-hinges, hopefully with some glass in it too. You are also able to open the car door, which is also a specialized type (this one is a mix between a standard door and a window). This shows that, once you know how to interact with the most generic type (basic door) you can also interact with specialized types (window, car door) as soon as they act like the ancestor type (e.g. as soon as they rotate on hinges).</p>

<p>This directly translates into OOP languages: polymorphism requires that <em>code written for a given type may also be run on derived types</em>. For example, a list (a generic list object, not a Python one) that can contain "numbers" shall be able to accept integers because they <em>are</em> numbers. The list could specify an ordering operation which requires the numbers to be able to compare each other. So, as soon as integers specify a way to compare each other they can be inserted into the list and ordered.</p>

<p>Statically compiled languages shall provide specific language features to implement this part of the polymorphism concept. In C++, for example, the language needs to introduce the concept of pointer compatibility between parent and child classes.</p>

<p>In Python there is no need to provide special language features to implement subtype polymorphism. As we already discovered Python functions accept any variable without checking the type and rely on the variable itself to provide the correct methods. But you already know that a subtype must provide the methods of the parent type, either redefining them or through implicit delegation, so as you can see Python implements subtype polymorphism from the very beginning.</p>

<p>I think this is one of the most important things to understand when working with this language. Python is not really interested in the actual type of the variables you are working with. It is interested in how those variables act, that is it just wants the variable <em>to provide the right methods</em>. So, if you come from statically typed languages, you need to make a special effort to think about <em>acting like</em> instead of <em>being</em>. This is what we called "duck typing".</p>

<p>Time to do an example. Let us define a <code>Room</code> class</p>

<p>``` python
class Room(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, door):
    self.door = door

def open(self):
    self.door.open()

def close(self):
    self.door.close()

def is_open(self):
    return self.door.is_open()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>A very simple class, as you can see, just enough to exemplify polymorphism. The <code>Room</code> class accepts a <code>door</code> variable, and the type of this variable is not specified. Duck typing in action: the actual type of <code>door</code> is not declared, there is no "acceptance test" built in the language. Indeed, the incoming variable shall export the following methods that are used in the <code>Room</code> class: <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>, <code>is_open()</code>. So we can build the following classes</p>

<p>``` python
class Door(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.status = "closed"

def open(self):
    self.status = "open"

def close(self):
    self.status = "closed"

def is_open(self):
    return self.status == "open"
</code></pre>

<p>class BooleanDoor(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.status = True

def open(self):
    self.status = True

def close(self):
    self.status = False

def is_open(self):
    return self.status
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Both represent a door that can be open or closed, and they implement the concept in two different ways: the first class relies on strings, while the second leverages booleans. Despite <em>being</em> two different types, both <em>act</em> the same way, so both can be used to build a <code>Room</code> object.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door = Door()
bool_door = BooleanDoor()
room = Room(door)
bool_room = Room(bool_door)</p>

<p>room.open()
print room.is_open()
True
room.close()
print room.is_open()
False</p>

<p>bool_room.open()
print bool_room.is_open()
True
bool_room.close()
print bool_room.is_open()
False
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<h4>File Like Us</h4>

<p>File-like objects are a concrete and very useful example of polymorphism in Python. A file-like object is a class (or the instance of a class) that acts like a file, i.e. it provides those methods a file object exposes.</p>

<p>Say for example that you code a class that parses an XML tree, and that you expect the XML code to be contained in a file. So your class accepts a file in its <code>__init__()</code> method, and reads the content from it</p>

<p>``` python
class XMLReader(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(xmlfile):
    xmlfile.open()
    self.content = xmlfile.read()
    xmlfile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>[...]
```</p>

<p>The class works well until your application shall be modified to receive XML content from a network stream. To use the class without modifying it you shall write the stream in a temporary file and load this latter, but this sounds a little overkill. So you plan to change the class to accept a string, but this way you shall change every single code that uses the class to read a file, since now you shall open, read and close the file on your own, outside the class.</p>

<p>Polymorphism offers a better way. Why not store the incoming stream inside an object that <em>acts like</em> a file, even if it is not an actual one? If you check the StringIO module you will find that such an object has been already invented and provided in the standard Python library.</p>

<p>Other very useful file-like classes are those contained in the <code>gzip</code>, <code>bz2</code>, and <code>zipfile</code> modules (just to name some of the most used), which provide objects that allow you to manage compressed files just like plain files, hiding the decompression/compression machinery.</p>

<h2>Unforgiveness</h2>

<p>EAFP is a Python acronym that stands for <em>easier to ask for forgiveness than permission</em>. This coding style is highly pushed in the Python community because it completely relies on the duck typing concept, thus fitting well with the language philosophy.</p>

<p>The concept behind EAFP is fairly easy: instead of checking if an object has a given attribute or method before actually accessing or using it, just trust the object to provide what you need and manage the error case. This can be probably better understood by looking at some code. According to EAFP, instead of writing</p>

<p>``` python
if hasattr(someobj, 'open'):</p>

<pre><code>[...]
</code></pre>

<p>else:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>you shall write</p>

<p>``` python
try:</p>

<pre><code>someobj.open()
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>except AttributeError:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you can see, the second snippet directly uses the method and deals with the possible <code>AttributeError</code> exception (by the way: managing exceptions is one of the top Black Magic Topics in Python, more on it in a future post. A very quick preview: I think we may learn something from Erlang - check <a href="/blog/2013/05/30/error-handling-in-erlang-a-primer/">this</a>).</p>

<p>Why is this coding style pushed so much in the Python community? I think the main reason is that through EAFP you <em>think</em> polymorphically: you are not interested in knowing if the object <em>has</em> the <code>open</code> attribute, you are interested in knowing if the object can satisfy your request, that is to perform the <code>open()</code> method call.</p>

<h2>Intermezzo</h2>

<p>Are you still with me? Good. Now go, make yourself a cup of tea and fasten belts: the Python roller coaster is about to start.</p>

<p>We will leave the polymorphism palace for a while to explore other parts of the Python OOP world. Don't worry, however, it is just to lay some foundation before diving another time into the matter.</p>

<h2>The Type Brothers</h2>

<p>The first step into the most intimate secrets of Python objects comes from two components we already met in the first post: <code>type</code> and <code>object</code>. These two things are the very fundamental elements of Python OOP system, so it is worth spending some time to understand how they work and relate each other.</p>

<p>First of all recall that in Python <em>everything is an object</em>, that is everything inherits from <code>object</code>. Thus, <code>object</code> seems to be the deepest thing you can find digging into Python variables. Let's check this</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>a = 5
type(a)
<type 'int'>
a.<strong>class</strong>
<type 'int'>
a.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>bases</strong>
(<type 'object'>,)
object.<strong>bases</strong>
()
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The variable <code>a</code> is an instance of the <code>int</code> class, and this latter inherits from <code>object</code>, which inherits from nothing. This demonstrates that <code>object</code> is at the top of the class hierarchy. However, as you can see, both <code>int</code> and <code>object</code> are called <em>types</em> (<code>&lt;type 'int'&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;type 'object'&gt;</code>), which in Python is a pure alias of the word <em>class</em>. Indeed, while <code>a</code> is an instance of the <code>int</code> class, <code>int</code> itself is an instance of another class, <em>a class that is instanced to build classes</em></p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>type(a)
<type 'int'>
type(int)
<type 'type'>
type(float)
<type 'type'>
type(dict)
<type 'type'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Since in Python everything is an object, everything is the instance of a class, even classes. Well, <code>type</code> is the class that is instanced to get classes. So remember this: <code>object</code> is the base of every object, <code>type</code> is the class of every type. Sounds puzzling? It is not your fault, don't worry. However, just to strike you with the finishing move, this is what Python is built on</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>type(object)
<type 'type'>
type.<strong>bases</strong>
(<type 'object'>,)
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>If you are not about to faint at this point chances are that you are Guido van Rossum of one of his friends down at the Python core development team (in this case let me thank you for your beautiful creation). You may get another cup of tea, if you need it.</p>

<p>Jokes apart, at the very base of Python type system there are two things, <code>object</code> and <code>type</code>, which are inseparable. The previous code shows that <code>object</code> is an instance of <code>type</code>, and <code>type</code> inherits from <code>object</code>. Take your time to understand this subtle concept, as it is very important for the upcoming discussion about metaclasses.</p>

<p>When you think you grasped the <code>type</code>/<code>object</code> matter read this and start thinking again</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>type(type)
<type 'type'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Hint: type is a class (i.e. a type). =)</p>

<h2>The Metaclasses Take Python</h2>

<p>You are now familiar with Python classes. You know that a class is used to create an instance, and that the structure of this latter is ruled by the source class and all its parent classes (until you reach <code>object</code>).</p>

<p>Since classes are objects too, you know that a class itself is an instance of a (super)class, and this class is <code>type</code>. That is, as already stated, <code>type</code> is the class that is used to build classes.</p>

<p>So for example you know that a class may be instanced, i.e. it can be called and by calling it you obtain another object that is linked with the class. What prepares the class for being called? What gives the class all its methods? In Python the class in charge of performing such tasks is called <em>metaclass</em>, and <code>type</code> is the default metaclass of all classes.</p>

<p>The point of exposing this structure of Python objects is that you may change the way classes are built. As you know, <code>type</code> is an object, so it can be subclassed just like any other class. Once you get a subclass of <code>type</code> you need to instruct your class to use it as the metaclass instead of type, and you can do this by setting the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class MyType(type):
...  pass
...
class MySpecialClass(object):
...  <strong>metaclass</strong> = MyType
...
msp = MySpecialClass()
type(msp)
<class '__main__.MySpecialClass'>
type(MySpecialClass)
<class '__main__.MyType'>
type(MyType)
<type 'type'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<h4>Metaclasses 2: Singleton Day</h4>

<p>Metaclasses are a very advanced topic in Python, but they have many practical uses. For example, by means of a custom metaclass you may log any time a class is instanced, which can be important for applications that shall keep a low memory usage or have to monitor it.</p>

<p>I am going to show here a very simple example of metaclass, the Singleton. Singleton is a well known design pattern, and many description of it may be found on the Internet. It has also been heavily criticized mostly because its bad behaviour when subclassed, but here I do not want to introduce it for its technological value, but for its simplicity (so please do not question the choice, it is just an example). Check the links at the bottom if you are interested in this topic.</p>

<p>Singleton has one purpose: to return the same instance every time it is instanced, like a sort of object-oriented global variable. So we need to build a class that does not work like standard classes, which return a new instance every time they are called.</p>

<p>"Build a class"? This is a task for metaclasses. The following implementation comes from <a href="http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Metaprogramming.html#intercepting-class-creation">Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms</a>, but is also valid for Python 2.x</p>

<p>``` python
class Singleton(type):</p>

<pre><code>instance = None
def __call__(cls, *args, **kw):
    if not cls.instance:
         cls.instance = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kw)
    return cls.instance
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We are defining a new type, which inherits from <code>type</code> to provide all bells and whistles of Python classes. We override the <code>__call__</code> method, that is a special method invoked when we call the class, i.e. when we instance it. The new method wraps the original method of <code>type</code> by calling it only when the <code>instance</code> attribute is not set, i.e. the first time the class is instanced, otherwise it just returns the recorded instance. As you can see this is a very basic cache class, the only trick is that it is applied to the creation of instances.</p>

<p>To test the new type we need to define a new class that uses it as its metaclass</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>class ASingleton(object):
...     <strong>metaclass</strong> = Singleton
...
a = ASingleton()
b = ASingleton()
a is b
True
hex(id(a))
'0xb6aae28cL'
hex(id(b))
'0xb6aae28cL'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>By using the <code>is</code> operator we test that the two objects are the very same structure in memory, that is their ids are the same, as explicitly shown. What actually happens is that when you issue <code>a = ASingleton()</code> the <code>ASingleton</code> class runs its <code>__call__()</code> method, which is taken from the <code>Singleton</code> type behind the class. That method recognizes that no instance has been created (<code>Singleton.instance</code> is <code>None</code>) and acts just like any standard class does. When you issue <code>b = ASingleton()</code> the very same things happen, but since <code>Singleton.instance</code> is now different from <code>None</code> its value (the previous instance) is directly returned.</p>

<p>Metaclasses are a very powerful programming tool and leveraging them you can achieve very complex behaviours with a small effort. Their use is a must every time you are actually metaprogramming, that is you are writing code that has to drive the way your code works. Good examples are creational patterns (injecting custom class attributes depending on some configuration), testing, debugging, and performance monitoring.</p>

<h2>Coming to Instance</h2>

<p>Before introducing you to a very smart use of metaclasses by talking about Abstract Base Classes (read: to save some topics for the third part of this series), I want to dive into the object creation procedure in Python, that is what happens when you instance a class. In the previous post this procedure was described only partially, by looking at the <code>__init_()</code> method.</p>

<p>In the first post I recalled the object-oriented concept of <em>constructor</em>, which is a special method of the class that is automatically called when the instance is created. The class may also define a destructor, which is called when the object is destroyed. In languages without a garbage collection mechanism such as C++ the destructor shall be carefully designed. In Python the destructor may be defined through the <code>__del__()</code> method, but it is hardly used.</p>

<p>The constructor mechanism in Python is on the contrary very important, and it is implemented by two methods, instead of just one: <code>__new__()</code> and <code>__init__()</code>. The tasks of the two methods are very clear and distinct: <code>__new__()</code> shall perform actions needed when <em>creating</em> a new instance while <code>__init__</code> deals with object <em>initialization</em>.</p>

<p>Since in Python you do not need to declare attributes due to its dynamic nature, <code>__new__()</code> is rarely defined by programmers, who may rely on <code>__init__</code> to perform the majority of the usual tasks. Typical uses of <code>__new__()</code> are very similar to those listed in the previous section, since it allows to trigger some code whenever your class is instanced.</p>

<p>The standard way to override <code>__new__()</code> is</p>

<p>``` python
class MyClass(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __new__(cls, *args, **kwds):
    obj = super(MyClass, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwds)
    [put your code here]
    return obj
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>just like you usually do with <code>__init__()</code>. When your class inherits from <code>object</code> you do not need to call the parent method (<code>object.__init__()</code>) because it is empty.</p>

<p>Remember that <code>__new__()</code> is not forced to return an instance of the class in which it is defined, even if you shall have very good reasons to break this behaviour. Anyway, <code>__init__()</code> will be called only if you return an instance of the container class. Please also note that <code>__new__()</code>, unlike <code>__init__()</code>, accepts the class as its first parameter. The name is not important in Python, and you can also call it <code>self</code>, but it is worth using <code>cls</code> to remember that it is not an instance.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been the leading programming paradigm for several decades now, starting from the initial attempts back in the 60s to some of the most important languages used nowadays. Being a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, OOP can never be said to be "correctly" or "fully" implemented by a language: indeed there are as many implementations as languages.</p>

<p>So one of the most interesting aspects of OOP languages is to understand how they implement those concepts. In this post I am going to try and start analyzing the OOP implementation of the Python language. Due to the richness of the topic, however, I consider this attempt just like a set of thoughts for Python beginners trying to find their way into this beautiful (and sometimes peculiar) language.</p>

<p>This first post covers the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Objects and types</li>
<li>Classes and instances</li>
<li>Object members: methods and attributes</li>
<li>Delegation: inheritance and composition</li>
</ul>


<p>This post refers to the internals of Python 2.x - please note that Python 3.x changes (improves!) some of the features shown here. You can find the <strong>updated version</strong> <a href="/blog/categories/python3/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Back to the Object</h2>

<p>Computer science deals with data and with procedures to manipulate that data. Everything, from the earliest Fortran programs to the latest mobile apps is about data and their manipulation.</p>

<p>So if data are the ingredients and procedures are the recipes, it seems (and can be) reasonable to keep them separate.</p>

<p>Let's do some procedural programming in Python</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<h1>This is some data</h1>

<p>data = (13, 63, 5, 378, 58, 40)</p>

<h1>This is a procedure that computes the average</h1>

<p>def avg(d):</p>

<pre><code>return sum(d)/len(d)
</code></pre>

<p>print avg(data)
```</p>

<p>As you can see the procedure is quite good and general: the procedure is run on a sequence of data, and it returns the average of the sequence items. So far, so good: computing the average of some numbers leaves the numbers untouched and creates new data.</p>

<p>The observation of the everyday world, however, shows that <em>complex data mutate</em>: an electrical device is on or off, a door is open or closed, the content of a bookshelf in your room changes as you buy new books.</p>

<p>You can still manage it keeping data and procedures separate, for example</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<h1>These are two numbered doors, initially closed</h1>

<p>door1 = [1, 'closed']
door2 = [2, 'closed']</p>

<h1>This procedure opens a door</h1>

<p>def open_door(door):</p>

<pre><code>door[1] = 'open'
</code></pre>

<p>open_door(door1)
print door1
```</p>

<p>I described a door as a structure containing a number and the status of the door. The procedure knows how this structure is made and may alter it.</p>

<p>This also works like a charm. Some problems arise, however, when we start building specialized types of data. What happens, for example, when I introduce a "lockable door" data type, which can be opened only when it is not locked? Let's see</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<h1>These are two standard doors, initially closed</h1>

<p>door1 = [1, 'closed']
door2 = [2, 'closed']</p>

<h1>This is a lockable door, initially closed and unlocked</h1>

<p>ldoor1 = [1, 'closed', 'unlocked']</p>

<h1>This procedure opens a standard door</h1>

<p>def open_door(door):</p>

<pre><code>door[1] = 'open'
</code></pre>

<h1>This procedure opens a lockable door</h1>

<p>def open_ldoor(door):</p>

<pre><code>if door[2] == 'unlocked`:
    door[1] = `open`
</code></pre>

<p>open_door(door1)
print door1</p>

<p>open_ldoor(ldoor1)
print ldoor1</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Everything still works, no surprises in this code. However, as you can see, I had to find a different name for the procedure that opens a locked door since its implementation differs from the procedure that opens a standard door. But, wait... I'm still opening a door, the action is the same, and it just changes the status of the door itself. So why shall I remember that a locked door shall be opened with <code>open_ldoor()</code> instead of <code>open_door()</code> if the verb is the same?</p>

<p>Chances are that this separation between data and procedures doesn't perfectly fit some situations. The key problem is that the "open" action is not actually <em>using</em> the door; rather it is <em>changing its state</em>. So, just like the volume control buttons of your phone, which are <em>on</em> your phone, the "open" procedure should stick to the "door" data.</p>

<p>This is exactly what leads to the concept of <em>object</em>: an object, in the OOP context, is a structure holding data <em>and</em> procedures operating on them.</p>

<h2>What About Type?</h2>

<p>When you talk about data you immediately need to introduce the concept of <em>type</em>. This concept may have two meanings that are worth being mentioned in computer science: the <em>behavioural</em> and the <em>structural</em> one.</p>

<p>The behavioural meaning represents the fact that you know what something is by describing how it acts. This is the foundation of the so-called "duck typing" (here "typing" means "to give a type" and not "to type on a keyboard"): if it <del>types</del> acts like a duck, it <em>is</em> a duck.</p>

<p>The structural meaning identifies the type of something by looking at its internal structure. So two things that act in the same way but are internally different are of different type.</p>

<p>Both points of view can be valid, and different languages may implement and emphasize one meaning of type or the other, and even both.</p>

<h2>Class Games</h2>

<p>Objects in Python may be built describing their structure through a <em>class</em>. A class is the programming representation of a generic object, such as "a book", "a car", "a door": when I talk about "a door" everyone can understand what I'm saying, without the need of referring to a specific door in the room.</p>

<p>In Python, the type of an object is represented by the class used to build the object: that is, in Python the word <em>type</em> has the same meaning of the word <em>class</em>.</p>

<p>For example, one of the built-in classes of Python is <code>int</code>, which represents an integer number</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>a = 6
print a
6
print type(a)
<type 'int'>
print a.<strong>class</strong>
<type 'int'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the built-in function <code>type()</code> returns the content of the <em>magic attribute</em> <code>__class__</code> (magic here means that its value is managed by Python itself offstage). The type of the variable <code>a</code>, or its class, is <code>int</code>. (This is a very inaccurate description of this rather complex topic, so remember that we are just scratching the surface).</p>

<p>Once you have a class you can <em>instantiate</em> it to get a concrete object (an <em>instance</em>) of that type, i.e. an object built according to the structure of that class. The Python syntax to instantiate a class is the same of a function call</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>b = int()
type(b)
<type 'int'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>When you create an instance, you can pass some values, according to the class definition, to <em>initialize</em> it.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>b = int()
print b
0
c = int(7)
print c
7
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>In this example, the <code>int</code> class creates an integer with value 0 when called without arguments, otherwise it uses the given argument to initialize the newly created object.</p>

<p>Let us write a class that represents a door to match the procedural examples done in the first section</p>

<p>``` python
class Door(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.number = number
    self.status = status

def open(self):
    self.status = 'open'

def close(self):
    self.status = 'closed'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>class</code> keyword defines a new class named <code>Door</code>; everything indented under <code>class</code> is part of the class. The functions you write inside the object are called <em>methods</em> and don't differ at all from standard functions; the name changes only to highlight the fact that those functions now are part of an object.</p>

<p>Methods of a class must accept as first argument a special value called <code>self</code> (the name is a convention but please never break it).</p>

<p>The class can be given a special method called <code>__init__()</code> which is run when the class is instantiated, receiving the arguments passed when calling the class; the general name of such a method, in the OOP context, is <em>constructor</em>, even if the <code>__init__()</code> method is not the only part of this mechanism in Python.</p>

<p>The <code>self.number</code> and <code>self.status</code> variables are called <em>attributes</em> of the object. In Python, methods and attributes are both <em>members</em> of the object and are accessible with the dotted syntax; the difference between attributes and methods is that the latter can be called (in Python lingo you say that a method is a <em>callable</em>).</p>

<p>As you can see the <code>__init__()</code> method shall create and initialize the attributes since they are not declared elsewhere.</p>

<p>The class can be used to create a concrete object</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1 = Door(1, 'closed')
type(door1)
<class '__main__.Door'>
print door1.number
1
print door1.status
closed
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Now <code>door1</code> is an instance of the <code>Door</code> class; <code>type()</code> returns the class as <code>__main__.Door</code> since the class was defined directly in the interactive shell, that is in the current main module. To call a method of an object, that is to run one of its internal functions, you just access it as an attribute with the dotted syntax and call it like a standard function.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.open()
print door1.number
1
print door1.status
open
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>In this case, the <code>open()</code> method of the <code>door1</code> instance has been called. No arguments have been passed to the <code>open()</code> method, but if you review the class declaration, you see that it was declared to accept an argument (<code>self</code>). When you call a method of an instance, Python automatically passes the instance itself to the method as the first argument.</p>

<p>You can create as many instances as needed and they are completely unrelated each other. That is the changes you make on one instance do not reflect on another instance of the same class.</p>

<h4>Recap</h4>

<p>Objects are described by a <em>class</em>, which can generate one or more <em>instances</em>, unrelated each other. A class contains <em>methods</em>, which are functions, and they accept at least one argument called <code>self</code>, which is the actual instance on which the method has been called. A special method, <code>__init__()</code> deals with the initialization of the object, setting the initial value of the <em>attributes</em>.</p>

<h2>Python Classes Strike Again</h2>

<p>The Python implementation of classes has some peculiarities. The bare truth is that in Python the class of an object is an object itself. You can check this by issuing <code>type()</code> on the class</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>type(door1)
<class '__main__.Door'>
print type(Door)
<type 'type'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This shows that the <code>Door</code> class is an object, an instance of the <code>type</code> class.</p>

<p>This concept is not so difficult to grasp as it can seem at first sight: in the real world we deal with concepts using them like <em>things</em>: for example we can talk about the concept of "door", telling people how a door looks like and how it works. So in our everyday experience the <em>type</em> of an object is an object itself. In Python this can be expressed by saying that <em>everything is an object</em>.</p>

<p>If the class is an instance it is a concrete object and is stored somewhere in memory. Let us leverage the <em>inspection</em> capabilities of Python and its <code>id()</code> function to check the status of our objects. The <code>id()</code> built-in function returns the memory position of an object.</p>

<p>First of all, let's check that the two objects are stored at different addresses</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>hex(id(door1))
'0x7fa4c818bad0'
hex(id(door2))
'0x7fa4c818b890'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This confirms that the two instances are separate and unrelated.
<strong>Please note that your values are very likely to be different from the ones I got.</strong></p>

<p>However if we use <code>id()</code> on the class of the two instances we discover that the class is <em>exactly</em> the same</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>hex(id(door1.<strong>class</strong>))
'0x766800'
hex(id(door2.<strong>class</strong>))
'0x766800'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Well this is very important. In Python, a class is not just the schema used to build an object. Rather, the class is a shared living object, which code is accessed at run time.</p>

<p>As we already tested, however, attributes are not stored in the class but in every instance, due to the fact that <code>__init__()</code> works on <code>self</code> when creating them. Classes, however, can be given attributes like any other object; with a terrific effort of imagination, let's call them <em>class attributes</em>.</p>

<p>As you can expect, class attributes are shared among the class instances just like their container</p>

<p>``` python
class Door(object):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'brown'

def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.number = number
    self.status = status

def open(self):
    self.status = 'open'

def close(self):
    self.status = 'closed'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>colour</code> attribute here is not created using <code>self</code>, and any change of its value reflects on all instances</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1 = Door(1, 'closed')
door2 = Door(2, 'closed')
Door.colour
'brown'
door1.colour
'brown'
door2.colour
'brown'
Door.colour = 'white'
Door.colour
'white'
door1.colour
'white'
door2.colour
'white'
hex(id(Door.colour))
'0xb74c5420L'
hex(id(door1.colour))
'0xb74c5420L'
hex(id(door2.colour))
'0xb74c5420L'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Raiders of the Lost Attribute</h2>

<p>Any Python object is automatically given a <code>__dict__</code> attribute, which contains its list of attributes. Let's investigate what this dictionary contains for our example objects:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Door.<strong>dict</strong>
dict_proxy({'<strong>module</strong>': '<strong>main</strong>',</p>

<pre><code>'colour': 'brown',
'__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'Door' objects&gt;,
'__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'Door' objects&gt;,
'close': &lt;function close at 0xb6a8a56c&gt;,
'open': &lt;function open at 0xb6a8a534&gt;,
'__doc__': None,
'__init__': &lt;function __init__ at 0xb6a8a48c&gt;})
</code></pre>

<p>door1.<strong>dict</strong>
{'status': 'closed', 'number': 1}
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Leaving aside the difference between a dictionary and a <code>dict_proxy</code> object, you can see that the <code>colour</code> attribute is listed among the <code>Door</code> class attributes, while <code>status</code> and <code>number</code> are listed for the instance.</p>

<p>How comes that we can call <code>door1.colour</code>, if that attribute is not listed for that instance? This is a job performed by the magic <code>__getattribute__()</code> method; in Python the dotted syntax automatically invokes this method so when we write <code>door1.colour</code>, Python executes <code>door1.__getattribute__('colour')</code>. That method performs the  <em>attribute  lookup</em> action, i.e. finds the value of the attribute by looking in different places.</p>

<p>The standard implementation of <code>__getattribute__()</code> searches first the internal dictionary (<code>__dict__</code>) of an object, then the type of the object itself; in this case <code>door1.__getattribute__('colour')</code> executes first <code>door1.__dict__['colour']</code> and then <code>door1.__class__.__dict__['colour']</code></p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'colour'
door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
'brown'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, if we check the objects equality through the <code>is</code> operator we can confirm that both <code>door1.colour</code> and <code>Door.colour</code> are exactly the same object</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.colour is Door.colour
True
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>When we try to assign a value to a class attribute directly on an instance, we just put in the <code>__dict__</code> of the instance a value with that name, and this value masks the class attribute since it is found first by <code>__getattribute__()</code>. As you can see from the examples of the previous section, this is different from changing the value of the attribute on the class itself.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.colour = 'white'
door1.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
'white'
door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
'brown'
Door.colour = 'red'
door1.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
'white'
door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['colour']
'red'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Revenge of the Methods</h2>

<p>Let's play the same game with methods. First of all you can see that, just like class attributes, methods are listed only in the class <code>__dict__</code>. Chances are that they behave the same as attributes when we get them</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.open is Door.open
False
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Whoops. Let us further investigate the matter</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Door.<strong>dict</strong>['open']
<function open at 0xb73ee10c>
Door.open
<unbound method Door.open>
door1.open
<bound method Door.open of <__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c>>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>So, the class method is listed in the members dictionary as <em>function</em>. So far, so good. The same method, taken directly from the class is returned as <em>unbound method</em>, while taking it from the instance it changes to <em>bound method</em>. Well, a <em>function</em> is a procedure you named and defined with the <code>def</code> statement. When you refer to a function as part of a class you get an unbound method. The name <em>method</em> simply means "a function inside a class", according to the usual OOP definitions, while <em>unbound</em> signals that the method is not bound to any instance. As you can see, as soon as you access the method from an instance, the method becomes <em>bound</em>.</p>

<p>Why does Python bother with methods being bound or unbound? And how does Python transform an unbound method into a bound one?</p>

<p>First of all, if you try to call an unbound method you get an error</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Door.open()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unbound method open() must be called with</p>

<pre><code>Door instance as first argument (got nothing instead)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>so by default Python considers methods as functions that shall operate on instances, and calling them from the class leaves the interpreter puzzled. Let us try to pass the instance as suggested by the exception message</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Door.open(door1)
door1.status
'open'
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Python does not complain here, and the method works as expected. So <code>Door.open(door1)</code> is the same as <code>door1.open()</code>. Again, under the hood, <code>__getattribute__()</code> is working to make everything work and when we call <code>door1.open()</code>, Python actually calls <code>door1.__class__.open(door1)</code>. However, <code>door1.__class__.open</code> is an unbound method, so there is something more that converts it into a bound method that Python can safely call.</p>

<p>When you access a member of an object, Python calls <code>__getattribute__()</code> to satisfy the request. This magic method, however, conforms to a procedure known as <em>descriptor protocol</em>. For the read access <code>__getattribute__()</code> checks if the object has a <code>__get__()</code> method and calls this latter. So for function the conversion from an unbound into a bound method is made by such a mechanism. Let us review it by means of an example.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open']
<function open at 0xb73ee10c>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This syntax retrieves the function defined in the class; the function knows nothing about objects, but it <em>is</em> an object (remember "everything is an object"). So we can look inside it with the <code>dir()</code> built-in function</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>dir(door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open'])
['<strong>call</strong>', '<strong>class</strong>', '<strong>closure</strong>', '<strong>code</strong>', '<strong>defaults</strong>',
 '<strong>delattr</strong>', '<strong>dict</strong>', '<strong>doc</strong>', '<strong>format</strong>', '<strong>get</strong>',
 '<strong>getattribute</strong>', '<strong>globals</strong>', '<strong>hash</strong>', '<strong>init</strong>',
 '<strong>module</strong>', '<strong>name</strong>', '<strong>new</strong>', '<strong>reduce</strong>', '<strong>reduce_ex</strong>',
 '<strong>repr</strong>', '<strong>setattr</strong>', '<strong>sizeof</strong>', '<strong>str</strong>', '<strong>subclasshook</strong>',
 'func_closure', 'func_code', 'func_defaults', 'func_dict', 'func_doc',
 'func_globals', 'func_name']
door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open'].<strong>get</strong>
&lt;method-wrapper '<strong>get</strong>' of function object at 0xb73ee10c>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, a <code>__get__</code> method is listed among the members of the function, and Python recognizes it as a <em>method-wrapper</em>. This method shall connect the <code>open</code> function to the <code>door1</code> instance, so we can call it passing the instance alone</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open'].<strong>get</strong>(door1)
<bound method ?.open of <__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c>>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Ok, something is missing. Indeed <code>__get__()</code> in this case also accepts the <em>owner</em> class, i.e. the class we are trying to get the attribute from. So the correct form is</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open'].<strong>get</strong>(door1, Door)
<bound method Door.open of <__main__.Door object at 0xb73f956c>>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>When methods met classes</h2>

<p>If we use <code>type()</code> on an unbound method, we get an interesting result</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['open']
<function open at 0xb6aa548c>
type(door1.<strong>class</strong>.open)
<type 'instancemethod'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The method is an <em>instance method</em>; as we discovered, it shall be bound to an instance to work, so the name is a good choice. Does this imply that we can also define a <em>class method</em>? Indeed we can, through the <code>classmethod</code> decorator</p>

<p>``` python
class Door(object):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'brown'

def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.number = number
    self.status = status

@classmethod
def knock(cls):
    print "Knock!"

def open(self):
    self.status = 'open'

def close(self):
    self.status = 'closed'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Such a definition makes the method callable on both the instance and the class</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.knock()
Knock!
Door.knock()
Knock!
door1.knock
<bound method type.knock of <class '__main__.Door'>>
Door.knock
<bound method type.knock of <class '__main__.Door'>>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>And this is possible since, as you can see, both the class method and the instance method are bound. The class method is bound to the class itself, while the instance method is bound to the instance of the class. What about the type of the method?</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['knock']
<classmethod object at 0xb6a8db6c>
type(door1.<strong>class</strong>.knock)
<type 'instancemethod'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Puzzled? Don't be confused! When you look in the <code>__dict__</code> you are not going through the <code>__getattribute__()</code> and <code>__get__()</code> machinery, so you get the plain unprocessed attribute. With standard methods you find <code>function</code> objects in the members dictionary, while for class methods you find <code>classmethod</code> objects.</p>

<p>On the other side, when you check the type of <code>door1.__class__.knock</code> you implicitly invoke <code>__get__()</code>, which binds the method to the class.</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>type(door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['knock'].<strong>get</strong>(door1, Door))
<type 'instancemethod'>
type(door1.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>['knock'])
<type 'classmethod'>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>After all, it is no surprise that a class method is bound since a class is an instance of <code>type</code>.</p>

<h2>Intermezzo</h2>

<p>I realize now that I introduced this post as "a set of thoughts for Python beginners". Sorry. If you are reading this, however, chances are that you are still alive. Calm down. Breathe. Relaxed? Ready to go? Let's dive into delegation!</p>

<h2>The Delegation Run</h2>

<p>If classes are objects what is the difference between types and instances? When I talk about "my cat" I am referring to a concrete instance of the "cat" concept, which is a <em>subtype</em> of "animal". So, despite being both objects, while types can be <em>specialized</em>, instances cannot.</p>

<p>Usually an object B is said to be a specialization of an object A when:</p>

<ul>
<li>B has all the features of A</li>
<li>B can provide new features</li>
<li>B can perform some or all the tasks performed by A in a different way</li>
</ul>


<p>Those targets are very general and valid for any system and the key to achieve them with the maximum reuse of already existing components is <em>delegation</em>. Delegation means that an object shall perform only what it knows best, and leave the rest to other objects.</p>

<p>Delegation can be implemented with two different mechanisms: <em>composition</em> and <em>inheritance</em>. Sadly, very often inheritance is listed among the pillars of OOP techniques, forgetting that it is an implementation of the more generic and fundamental mechanism of delegation; perhaps a better nomenclature for the two techniques could be <em>explicit delegation</em> (composition) and <em>implicit delegation</em> (inheritance). Please note that, again, when talking about composition and inheritance we are talking about focusing on a behavioural or structural delegation. Another way to think about the difference between composition and inheritance is to consider if the object <em>knows</em> who can satisfy your request or if the object <em>is</em> the one that satisfy the request.</p>

<p>Please, please, please do not forget composition: in many cases, composition can lead you to a simpler system, with benefits on maintainability and changeability.</p>

<p>Usually composition is said to be a very generic technique that needs no special syntax, while inheritance and its rules are strongly dependent on the language of choice. Actually, the strong dynamic nature of Python softens the boundary line between the two techniques.</p>

<h2>Inheritance Now</h2>

<p>In Python a class can be declared as an <em>extension</em> of one or more different classes, through the <em>class inheritance</em> mechanism. The child class (the one that inherits) internally has the same structure of the parent class (the one that is inherited), and for the case of multiple inheritance the language has very specific rules to manage possible conflicts or redefinitions among the parent classes. A very simple example of inheritance is</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(Door):</p>

<pre><code>pass
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>where we declare a new class <code>SecurityDoor</code> that, at the moment, is a perfect copy of the <code>Door</code> class. Let us investigate what happens when we access attributes and methods. First we instance the class</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>sdoor = SecurityDoor(1, 'closed')
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The first check we can do is that class attributes are still global and shared</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>SecurityDoor.colour is Door.colour
True
sdoor.colour is Door.colour
True
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This shows us that Python tries to resolve instance members not only looking into the class the instance comes from, but also investigating the parent classes. In this case <code>sdoor.colour</code> becomes <code>SecurityDoor.colour</code>, that in turn becomes <code>Door.colour</code>. <code>SecurityDoor</code> <em>is</em> a <code>Door</code>.</p>

<p>If we investigate the content of <code>__dict__</code> we can catch a glimpse of the inheritance mechanism in action</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>sdoor.<strong>dict</strong>
{'status': 'closed', 'number': 1}
sdoor.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>dict</strong>
dict_proxy({'<strong>module</strong>': '<strong>main</strong>', '<strong>doc</strong>': None})
Door.<strong>dict</strong>
dict_proxy({'knock': <classmethod object at 0xb6a8db6c>,</p>

<pre><code>'__module__': '__main__',
'__weakref__': &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'Door' objects&gt;,
'__dict__': &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'Door' objects&gt;,
'close': &lt;function close at 0xb6aa5454&gt;,
'colour': 'brown',
'open': &lt;function open at 0xb6aa53e4&gt;,
'__doc__': None,
'__init__': &lt;function __init__ at 0xb6aa51ec&gt;})
</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see the content of <code>__dict__</code> for <code>SecurityDoor</code> is very narrow compared to that of <code>Door</code>. The inheritance mechanism takes care of the missing elements by climbing up the classes tree. Where does Python get the parent classes? A class always contains a <code>__bases__</code> tuple that lists them</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>SecurityDoor.<strong>bases</strong>
(<class '__main__.Door'>,)
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>So an example of what Python does to resolve a class method call through the inheritance tree is</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>sdoor.<strong>class</strong>.<strong>bases</strong>[0].<strong>dict</strong>['knock'].<strong>get</strong>(sdoor, SecurityDoor)
<bound method type.knock of <class '__main__.SecurityDoor'>>
sdoor.knock
<bound method type.knock of <class '__main__.SecurityDoor'>>
```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Please note that this is just an example that does not consider multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>Let us try now to override some methods and attributes. In Python you can <em>override</em> (redefine) a parent class member simply by redefining it in the child class.</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(Door):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'gray'
locked = True

def open(self):
    if not self.locked:
        self.status = 'open'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you can forecast, the overridden members now are present in the <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>SecurityDoor</code> class</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>SecurityDoor.<strong>dict</strong>
dict_proxy({'locked': True,</p>

<pre><code>'__module__': '__main__',
'open': &lt;function open at 0xb73d8844&gt;,
'colour': 'gray',
'__doc__': None})
</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>So when you override a member, the one you put in the child class is used instead of the one in the parent class simply because the former is found before the latter while climbing the class hierarchy. This also shows you that Python does not implicitly call the parent implementation when you override a method. So, overriding is a way to block implicit delegation.</p>

<p>If we want to call the parent implementation we have to do it explicitly. In the former example we could write</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(Door):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'gray'
locked = True

def open(self):
    if self.locked:
        return
    Door.open(self)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You can easily test that this implementation is working correctly. This form of explicit parent delegation is heavily discouraged, however.</p>

<p>The first reason is because of the very high coupling that results from explicitly naming the parent class again when calling the method; if you decide to use a new parent class you have to manually propagate the change to every method that calls it. Moreover, since in Python the class hierarchy can be dynamically changed (i.e. at runtime), this form of explicit delegation could be not only annoying but wrong.</p>

<p>The second reason is that in general you need to deal with multiple inheritance, where you do not know a priori which parent class implements the original form of the method you are overriding.</p>

<p>To solve these issues, Python supplies the <code>super()</code> built-in function, that climbs the class hierarchy and returns the correct class that shall be called. The syntax for calling <code>super()</code> is</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(Door):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'gray'
locked = True

def open(self):
    if self.locked:
        return
    super(SecurityDoor, self).open(self)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As you can see you have to explicitly pass the class you are in and the current instance. This is a (indeed very light) form of repetition that has been fixed in Python 3.x.</p>

<h2>Enter the Composition</h2>

<p>Composition means that an object knows another object, and explicitly delegates some tasks to it. While inheritance is implicit, composition is explicit: in Python, however, things are far more interesting than this =).</p>

<p>First of all let us implement classic composition, which simply makes an object part of the other as an attribute</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(object):</p>

<pre><code>colour = 'gray'
locked = True

def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.door = Door(number, status)

def open(self):
    if self.locked:
        return
    self.door.open()

def close(self):
    self.door.close()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The primary goal of composition is to relax the coupling between objects. This little example shows that now <code>SecurityDoor</code> is an <code>object</code> and no more a <code>Door</code>, which means that the internal structure of <code>Door</code> is not copied. For this very simple example both <code>Door</code> and <code>SecurityDoor</code> are not big classes, but in a real system objects can very complex; this means that their allocation consumes a lot of memory and if a system contains thousands or millions of objects that could be an issue.</p>

<p>As you can see, however, our solution is far from perfect.</p>

<p>The composed <code>SecurityDoor</code> has to redefine the <code>colour</code> attribute since the concept of delegation applies only to methods and not to attributes, doesn't it? Well, no. Python provides a very high degree of indirection for objects manipulation and attribute access is one of the most useful. As you already discovered, accessing attributes is ruled by a special method called <code>__getattribute__()</code> that is called whenever an attribute of the object is accessed. Overriding <code>__getattribute__()</code>, however, is overkill; it is a very complex method, and, being called on every attribute access, any change makes the whole thing slower.</p>

<p>The method we have to leverage to delegate attribute access is <code>__getattr__()</code>, which is a special method that is called whenever the requested attribute is not found in the object. So basically it is the right place to dispatch all attribute and method access our object cannot handle. In the previous example</p>

<p>``` python
class SecurityDoor(object):</p>

<pre><code>locked = True

def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.door = Door(number, status)

def open(self):
    if self.locked:
        return
    self.door.open()

def __getattr__(self, attr):
    return getattr(self.door, attr)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Using <code>__getattr__()</code> blends the separation line between inheritance and composition since after all the former is a form of automatic delegation of every member access.</p>

<p>``` python
class ComposedDoor(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, number, status):
    self.door = Door(number, status)

def __getattr__(self, attr):
    return getattr(self.door, attr)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As this last example shows, delegating every member access through <code>__getattr__()</code> is very simple. Pay attention to <code>getattr()</code> which is different from <code>__getattr__()</code>. The former is a built-in that is equivalent to the dotted syntax, i.e. <code>getattr(obj, 'someattr')</code> is the same as <code>obj.someattr</code>, but you have to use it since the name of the attribute is contained in a string.</p>

<p>Composition provides a superior way to manage delegation since it can selectively delegate the access, even mask some attributes or methods, while inheritance cannot. In Python you also avoid the memory problems that might arise when you put many objects inside another; Python handles everything through its reference, i.e. through a pointer to the memory position of the thing, so the size of an attribute is constant and very limited.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<p>There is much more that can be said about the Python implementation of objects, classes, and friends. Just to name a couple of things, the object creation mechanism and the relationship between <code>object</code> and <code>type</code> have not been explained. Hopefully, there will be space in a later post. In the second post, however, I'll start talking about polymorphism, Abstract Base Classes, and metaclasses. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Movie Trivia</h2>

<p>If you are wondering why section titles are so weird, chances are that you missed some good movies to watch while you are not coding =). The movies are: <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>What About Bob?</em>, <em>Wargames</em>, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>The Cannonball Run</em>, <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, <em>Enter the Dragon</em>.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>2014-03-08: "When methods met classes" section had a typo: the sentence "The class method is bound to the class itself, while the instance method is bound to the class of the instance." is "while the instance method is bound to instance of the class.". Thanks <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116309787480950087834/posts">Mohcin Shah</a> for spotting it!</p>

<p>2014-03-10: Fixed link to Alex Martelli's presentation.</p>
